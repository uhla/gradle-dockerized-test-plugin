Windows with podman:

Podman is running in WSL2 with interface podman0
Gradle main worker process is running from windows host
WSL has bridge adapter interface defined in windows

Need to route traffic podman container -> podman gateway (10.88.0.1/host.containers.internal) -> foward to windows host
+ deal with firewall issues.

This is pretty advanced networking stuff, so will have to be sorted out in the future (and all these things should be configurable from extension)


--------------
Connecting from WSL to Host (with port open in win firewall)

# windows ethernet interface on host
nc -vz 10.xx.xx.xx 49664
Connection to 10.xx.xx.xx 49664 port [tcp/*] succeeded!

# wlan on win host
nc -vz 192.168.xx.xx 49664
timeout

# WSL ethernet bridge interface on win host
nc -vz 172.yy.yy.yy 49664
Connection to 172.yy.yy.yy 49664 port [tcp/*] succeeded!

For convenience testing there is testModule directory `./gradlew test` inside the module

Consider using ryuk container to shutdown inactive containers if something fails and does not clean up properly
