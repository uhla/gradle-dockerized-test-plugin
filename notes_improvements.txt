Windows with podman:

Podman is running in WSL2 with interface podman0
Gradle main worker process is running from windows host
WSL has bridge adapter interface defined in windows

Need to route traffic podman container -> podman gateway (10.88.0.1/host.containers.internal) -> foward to windows host
+ deal with firewall issues.

This is pretty advanced networking stuff, so will have to be sorted out in the future (and all these things should be configurable from extension)
